          <h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h1>
          <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] 
            up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] 
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. 
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
            (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the 
            clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India,
             the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] 
             Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to 
             Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

          <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h1>
            <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating 
              beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.[2]
              Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, 
              short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
               while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed 
               with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used 
               in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, 
               liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as 
               sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 
               BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United 
               States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] 
               but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from 
               younger cows (calves) is called veal.

          <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h1>
          <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), 
            usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, 
            and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also 
            referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]
            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it 
            can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, 
            yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled 
            ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
